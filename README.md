# Setup and Run
Firstly, make sure you are using the correct version of NODE. You can check on the .nvmrc file on the root of the project. I recommend you to install[ NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for switching between different versions of NODE. <br>
With NVM installed, run the command:
- ``` nvm use ```
<br>
using `node --version` you can double check if the version matches.
